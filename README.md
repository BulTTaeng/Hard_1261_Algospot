## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , 0-1 bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was think that I should use 0-1 bfs.

Because we did not count the cost of moving , this problem is same with starting from every '0' (empty) location and find the min distance to (N ,M).

So, after putting every '0' spot to the front fo deque and if we have to break a wall , put it in the back of deque.

After that , when we reach (N , M) , print it and end.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
